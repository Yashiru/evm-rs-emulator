# EVM Rust Emulator

The EVM Rust Emulator is a simple in-memory Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for developers who want to test EVM bytecode execution directly in a Rust crate, without using a full EVM node with his RPC to interact with a blockchain.
