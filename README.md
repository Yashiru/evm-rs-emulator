# EVM Rust Emulator

The EVM Rust Emulator is a simple in-memory Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for developers who want to test EVM bytecode execution directly in a command line or in a Rust crate, without using a full EVM node with his RPC to interact with a blockchain.

    <h2>Rust crate</h2>
    <p>üëâ Use the evm-rs-emulator crate in your rust project.</p>
  </summary>

  ## Install crate
  ```bash
  cargo add evm-rs-emulator
  ```

  ## Usage
  ```rust
  use evm_rs_emulator::Runner;

  fn main() {
    let caller = [
      0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
      0x00, 0x00, 0xc4, 0x11, 0xe8,
    ];
    let origin: Option<[u8; 20]> = None;
    let address: Option<[u8; 20]> = None
    let value: Option<[u8; 32]> = None;
    let data: Option<Vec<u8>> = None;
    let bytecode: Vec<u8> = vec![0x60, 0xff, 0x60, 0xff];
    
    // Create a new interpreter
    let mut runner =
        Runner::new(caller, origin, address, value, data, None);

    // Run all the bytecode
    let _ = interpreter.interpret(bytecode, Some(255), true);

    // Or run the bytecode OPCODE by OPCODE
    runner.bytecode = bytecode;
    runner.debug_level = Some(255);
    // Run the first 3 opcodes
    let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
    let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
    let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
  }
  ```

    <h2>Command line interface</h2>
    <p>üëâ Use the evm-rs-emulator as a CLI.</p>
  </summary>

  ## Installation (UNIX-like OS)
  Run this command to install evm-rs:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Yashiru/evm-rs-emulator.git && \
    cd evm-rs-emulator && \
    ./install && cd .. && \
    rm -rf evm-rs-emulator
  ```
  > **Note**  
  > The install script runs sudo commands.

  ### Uninstall
  Remove the binary:
  ```bash 
  sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/evm-rs
  ```

  ### Execute bytecode
  You can run raw bytecode or give a file containing the bytecode in parameter. 
  
  > **Note**  
  > When running some bytecode, the bytecode is deployed at a contract address and the contract is called with the provided data.

  ```bash
  # Run bytecode in a file
  evm-rs ./bytecode.bin

  # Run raw bytecode
  evm-rs 0x60ff60ff
  ```

  #### Command Line Arguments

  - **--address**  
  Set the address of the contract containing the provided bytecode.

  - **--caller**  
  Set the caller address.

  - **--data**  
  Set the data to be passed to the contract.

  - **--origin**  
  Set the origin address.

  - **--value**  
  Set the value to be sent to the contract.

  - **--fork**  
  Set the fork RPC url to be used when local storage reads return nothing.

  - **--help**  
  Display the help message, listing available arguments and their usage.

  - **--version**  
  Display the current version of the CLI.
