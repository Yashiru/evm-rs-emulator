# EVM Rust Emulator

The EVM Rust Emulator is a simple in-memory Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for developers who want to test EVM bytecode execution directly in a Rust crate, without using a full EVM node with his RPC to interact with a blockchain.

## Run some bytecode
Put the bytecode to run in `bytecode.bin` file and run the following command.
```bash
cargo run
```

## Disclaimer
This crate is in development and it is at this point only a bytecode interpreter with a full EVM emulation. It require a lib module with all external accessible features to make this crate a real lib crate that can be used as an external crate in other projects.
