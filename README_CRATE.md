# EVM Rust Emulator

The EVM Rust Emulator is a simple in-memory Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for developers who want to test EVM bytecode execution directly in a command line or in a Rust crate, without using a full EVM node with his RPC to interact with a blockchain.

## Rust crate

### Install crate
```bash
cargo add evm-rs-emulator
```

### Usage
```rust
use evm_rs_emulator::Runner;

fn main() {
  let caller = [
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
    0x00, 0x00, 0xc4, 0x11, 0xe8,
  ];
  let origin: Option<[u8; 20]> = None;
  let address: Option<[u8; 20]> = None
  let value: Option<[u8; 32]> = None;
  let data: Option<Vec<u8>> = None;
  let bytecode: Vec<u8> = vec![0x60, 0xff, 0x60, 0xff];
  
  // Create a new interpreter
  let mut runner =
      Runner::new(caller, origin, address, value, data, None);

  // Run all the bytecode
  let _ = interpreter.interpret(bytecode, Some(255), true);

  // Or run the bytecode OPCODE by OPCODE
  runner.bytecode = bytecode;
  runner.debug_level = Some(255);
  // Run the first 3 opcodes
  let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
  let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
  let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
}
```
